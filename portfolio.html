	    	<h3>Android App Project</h3>
	<p> Our game “Space Adventure” was made similarly to the game “Flappy Bird” in which
the player jumps between two obstacles while being dragged down by gravity. Throughout
creating the app my partner and I had various problems when coding.The first and biggest
problem was the satellite movement, when the app was booted the top satellite was stuck at the
bottom of the screen while the bottom moved at the top then proceeded to be stuck when the
edge was reached. The solution was strange, the top satellite’s y-value ended up being smaller
than the bottom and the movement was more consistent for both satellites when I changed the
x-value to 200. The second biggest problem was with the satellite size and position. Whenever
the satellite reached the edge of the screen, the bottom sprite would clip into the top sprite, this
confused me and my partner since we couldn’t tell what the problem was, until we started
investigating the sprite’s sizes. Although the designer tab displayed differently, the image sizes
were too large for the emulator, this caused collision issues whenever the sprites were told to
reset, we didn’t realize this until we had the emulator working and we quickly lowered their
sizes. With the satellite gravity working properly, I programed the score to be changed and a
point sound to be played whenever the satellites met with the edge, this was a crucial part of how
our scoring system worked. Individually, I worked on the sound design and the score system for
the satellites. I used a label for the score and a simple math block to add 100 points.</p>
